<h1>Girl Story</h1>
<p>
	 girl is a young female human, usually a <strong>child</strong> or an adolescent. When a girl becomes an adult, she is accurately described as a woman. However, the term girl is also used for other meanings, including young woman,[1] and is sometimes used as a synonym for daughter,[2] or girlfriend.[citation needed] In certain contexts, the usage of girl for a woman may be derogatory. Girl may also be a term of endearment used by an adult, usually a woman, to designate adult female friends. Girl also appears in portmanteaus (compound words) like showgirl, cowgirl, and schoolgirl.</p>
